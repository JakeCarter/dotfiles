# PATH - I would like to setup `PATH` in `.zshenv` but becasue of zsh config ordering, `/etc/zprofile` will get called after which will cuase other paths to come before the ones I set here. To get around that, I'm putting the `PATH` setup here in `.zshrc`
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/brew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/opt/brew/sbin:$PATH
export PATH=${DOTFILES_PATH}/bin:$PATH # DOTFILES_PATH defined in `dotfiles-path-finder.zsh`

# set editor to nvim if it exists, otherwise set it to vim
# Need to move this to zshrc because nvim won't be in $PATH until path is set above
if command -v nvim &> /dev/null; then
    export EDITOR='nvim'
else
    export EDITOR='vim'
fi
